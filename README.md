*Do the same as in the video, but then without using TypeScript.*

**Usage:**

cd into a directory, install dependencies and run the dev server and finally view on your browser.

**Example:**

cd v0.0.1

npm install

npm run serve

**Versions**

v0.0.1 - This is the empty starting point. (until 1:48 in the video)

v0.0.2 - Now Pinia got installed and configured. (until 2:40 in the video)

v0.0.3 - The problem is that there is no zero shown under Hello World. (until 7:39 in the video)

v0.0.4 - Using a compositions API fix from https://vuejs.org/tutorial/#step-2.
But this fix is not using Pinia! (until 7:39 in the video)

v0.0.5 -
