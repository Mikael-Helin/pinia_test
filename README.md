Do the same as in the video, but without using TypeScript.

**Usage:**

cd into a directory, install dependencies and run the dev server.

**Example:**

cd v0.0.1

npm install

npm run serve

**Versions**

v0.0.1 - This is the empty starting point. (until 1:48 in the video)
v0.0.2 - Now Pinia got installed.
